# vrp_dealerships

This is a vrp2 template with reactjs for the UI.

# usage

open script in vscode, and open the terminal. Type the following: `cd web` then type `yarn`. After typing yarn you should see it loading and istalling packages and dependencies. Once it's done, type: `yarn start` for previewing the UI in your browser, or type: `yarn start:game` to have the UI auto build for you when you save a file, so all you need to do is restart the script to see UI changes.

# Disclaimer

Please note that this is meant for the vRP2 framework, not standalone. Please don't change anything in the fxmanifest.lua file, as it'll most likely break the script.
